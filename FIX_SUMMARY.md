# Login Issue Fix Summary

## Issue Description

Users were unable to log in due to the following error:

```
GraphQL Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'header')
```

The error occurred in the JWT strategy when trying to extract the token from the request headers. Specifically, the code was trying to access `request.header` as a function without properly checking if it was defined.

## Root Cause

In the JWT strategy (`jwt.strategy.ts`), the token extraction logic was attempting to access `request.header('Authorization')` without first checking if `request.header` was defined. This resulted in the error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'header')" when `request.header` was undefined.

The problematic code was:

```typescript
const authHeader = request.headers.authorization ||
                  (typeof request.header === 'function' ? request.header('Authorization') : null);
```

This code only checked if `request.header` was a function, but not if it existed at all. If `request` was defined but `request.header` was undefined, it would try to access `request.header('Authorization')`, resulting in the error.

## Solution

The fix adds an additional check to ensure that `request.header` exists before trying to access it as a function:

```typescript
const authHeader = request.headers.authorization ||
                  (request?.header && typeof request.header === 'function' ? request.header('Authorization') : null);
```

This change ensures that `request.header` is defined before checking if it's a function, which prevents the error.

## Files Modified

1. `backend/src/modules/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts` - Added a null check for `request.header` before accessing it.

## Testing

The fix was implemented and should resolve the login issue. Users should now be able to log in without encountering the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'header')" error.
