# TypeScript Monorepo Optimization Plan

## Assumptions

1. The application is a TypeScript monorepo with NestJS backend and React frontend
2. The backend uses GraphQL (Apollo Server), Prisma, and JWT authentication
3. The frontend uses React, React Query, and Tailwind CSS
4. The database is PostgreSQL in production (via Docker) but SQLite in development
5. The application has basic authentication and user management functionality
6. The application is deployed using Docker Compose
7. The expected traffic is moderate, with potential for growth

## Prioritized Implementation Plan

This plan is organized by impact vs. effort, with dependencies noted. Each task includes acceptance criteria and rollback strategy.

### 1. GraphQL Stack Unification (High Impact, Low Effort)

**Goal**: Migrate to a single Apollo stack and remove legacy/duplicate packages

**Tasks**:
1. Remove apollo-server-express dependency
2. Ensure Apollo Server v4 with @nestjs/graphql v12 is properly configured
3. Update client-side GraphQL implementation to use React Query

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- No apollo-server-express in dependencies
- All GraphQL operations work correctly
- Bundle size is reduced

**Rollback Strategy**:
- Keep a backup of package.json and GraphQL implementation files
- Revert changes if any functionality breaks

### 2. Implement N+1 Query Optimization with DataLoader (High Impact, Medium Effort)

**Goal**: Prevent N+1 query problems by implementing DataLoader pattern

**Tasks**:
1. Create a DataLoader service for Prisma
2. Integrate DataLoader with GraphQL resolvers
3. Add examples of usage in existing resolvers

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Number of database queries is reduced for nested queries
- Response time for complex queries is improved
- DataLoader is properly integrated with the request lifecycle

**Rollback Strategy**:
- Keep original resolver implementations
- Revert to original implementation if performance degrades

### 3. Enhance GraphQL Query Safety and Efficiency (High Impact, Low Effort)

**Goal**: Improve GraphQL security and performance

**Tasks**:
1. Add depth and complexity limits to GraphQL schema
2. Disable introspection and playground in production
3. Implement HTTP batching and Automatic Persisted Queries (APQ)
4. Enable compression and keep-alive

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- GraphQL queries with excessive depth or complexity are rejected
- Introspection and playground are disabled in production
- HTTP batching and APQ are working correctly
- Response size is reduced with compression

**Rollback Strategy**:
- Keep original GraphQL configuration
- Revert changes if any functionality breaks

### 4. Optimize Database Efficiency (High Impact, Medium Effort)

**Goal**: Improve database performance and query efficiency

**Tasks**:
1. Update Prisma schema to support both PostgreSQL and SQLite
2. Add missing DB indexes based on query patterns
3. Implement narrow select/include patterns based on GraphQL selection set
4. Add server-side pagination, filtering, and sorting to GraphQL API
5. Implement cursor-based pagination for large lists

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexes
- Only requested fields are fetched from the database
- Pagination, filtering, and sorting work correctly
- Performance is improved for large lists

**Rollback Strategy**:
- Keep original schema and query implementations
- Revert changes if performance degrades

### 5. Implement Environment Validation (Medium Impact, Low Effort)

**Goal**: Ensure application fails fast with invalid configuration

**Tasks**:
1. Add schema validation for environment variables using zod
2. Update .env.example with all required variables
3. Resolve JWT secret discrepancies

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Application fails to start with invalid configuration
- .env.example contains all required variables with descriptions
- JWT secret handling is consistent

**Rollback Strategy**:
- Keep original configuration handling
- Revert changes if startup issues occur

### 6. Enhance Security Measures (High Impact, Medium Effort)

**Goal**: Improve application security

**Tasks**:
1. Configure CORS with strict allowlist
2. Enhance Helmet configuration
3. Add throttling on auth endpoints
4. Implement secure cookie and token handling
5. Add safe error responses

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- CORS is properly configured with allowlist
- Helmet is configured with secure defaults
- Auth endpoints are protected against brute force attacks
- Cookies are HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite
- Error responses don't leak sensitive information

**Rollback Strategy**:
- Keep original security configuration
- Revert changes if functionality breaks

### 7. Add Logging, Tracing, and Monitoring (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)

**Goal**: Improve observability and debugging

**Tasks**:
1. Implement structured logging with pino
2. Add request-id correlation
3. Implement basic OpenTelemetry/Prometheus metrics

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Logs are structured and include request correlation
- Basic metrics are available (latency, error rate, DB pool)
- Logs and metrics are accessible in development and production

**Rollback Strategy**:
- Keep original logging implementation
- Revert changes if performance degrades

### 8. Optimize Client Performance (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)

**Goal**: Improve frontend performance and developer experience

**Tasks**:
1. Configure React Query defaults (staleTime, cacheTime, retries)
2. Implement code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense
3. Add ErrorBoundary components
4. Integrate GraphQL Codegen for typed operations
5. Add APQ integration on the client

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- React Query is properly configured
- Bundle size is reduced with code splitting
- Errors are properly handled with ErrorBoundary
- GraphQL operations are type-safe
- Network requests are reduced with APQ

**Rollback Strategy**:
- Keep original client implementation
- Revert changes if functionality breaks

### 9. Improve CI/CD and Containerization (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)

**Goal**: Improve deployment process and container security

**Tasks**:
1. Create multi-stage Dockerfiles
2. Add frontend service to docker-compose.yml
3. Add health checks, resource limits, and non-root user configuration
4. Set up CI pipeline (typecheck, lint, tests, build, audit)
5. Configure dependency updates (Renovate/Dependabot)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Docker images are smaller and more secure
- Frontend and backend services are properly configured
- Health checks are implemented
- CI pipeline runs successfully
- Dependency updates are automated

**Rollback Strategy**:
- Keep original Docker configuration
- Revert changes if deployment issues occur

### 10. Write Tests and Verification Procedures (Medium Impact, High Effort)

**Goal**: Ensure code quality and prevent regressions

**Tasks**:
1. Add unit tests for critical functionality
2. Create E2E test examples for GraphQL queries/mutations
3. Add tests for auth flows
4. Document verification steps and metrics

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Critical functionality is covered by tests
- E2E tests verify end-to-end functionality
- Auth flows are properly tested
- Verification steps and metrics are documented

**Rollback Strategy**:
- Tests can be added incrementally without affecting existing functionality

## Implementation Dependencies

1. GraphQL Stack Unification should be done first as it affects many other tasks
2. Environment Validation should be done early to ensure consistent configuration
3. Database Optimization depends on understanding query patterns from GraphQL usage
4. N+1 Query Optimization should be done after GraphQL Stack Unification
5. Client Performance Optimization depends on GraphQL Stack Unification
6. Security Enhancements can be done independently but should be done before deployment
7. CI/CD and Containerization should be done after most other tasks

## Measurable Success Metrics

1. **Performance**:
   - p95 latency for GraphQL queries < 200ms
   - Average number of DB queries per request < 5
   - Client-side bundle size reduced by 20%
   - Time to interactive reduced by 30%

2. **Security**:
   - No high or critical vulnerabilities in dependency audit
   - All security headers properly configured
   - Auth endpoints protected against brute force attacks

3. **Developer Experience**:
   - Type-safe GraphQL operations
   - Consistent environment configuration
   - Automated tests for critical functionality
   - Automated dependency updates

4. **Observability**:
   - Structured logs with request correlation
   - Basic metrics for latency, error rate, and DB pool
   - Health checks for all services

## Next Steps

After implementing these improvements, consider:

1. Switching to Fastify adapter for NestJS for better performance
2. Adding response caching (LRU/Redis) for hot queries
3. Implementing more comprehensive E2E and contract tests
4. Adding pre-commit hooks with husky and lint-staged
